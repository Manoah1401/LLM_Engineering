Hi Reader!! Welcome to my Github Repository.
This repository documents my learning journey through the Udemy “AI Engineer Core Track: LLM Engineering, RAG, QLoRA, Agents” course by Ed Donner.
I'm using this space to practice core concepts, build small projects, and experiment with tools across the LLM engineering stack.

##What’s Inside
  -Week-wise folders containing notebooks, exercises, and experiments
  -Hands-on work with:
    Tokenization
    Prompt engineering
    Model fine-tuning
    Vector databases
    RAG pipelines
    Evaluation and debugging techniques
  Personal notes and small utilities I build along the way

#Why This Repo
To track my progress, stay consistent, and maintain a daily coding habit while building foundational LLM engineering skills.

#How to Use
Each week has its own folder with Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.
Feel free to explore, adapt, or learn from the structure.
